# Rick Brown

<div align="center">

I am a self taught developer, based in the South East of England.

At 46, my career had always been in the motor trade, but I decided I wanted to pursue my childhood dream of working within the tech industry. I have taught myself most aspects of React development, from HTML & CSS through the MERN stack and into docker.

I love writing clean, re-usable code, and I believe I am ready for my first tech appointment.

_Thank you for reading my resume. If you want to contact me,_
_Please send me an email._
